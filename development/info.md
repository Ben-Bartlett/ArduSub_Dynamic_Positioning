#Development

Included here is the file that was “finished” for the Final Year Project submission which includes data logging functions and plotting files (which was faster than utilising LibreOffice Calc or similar).

This was tidied up for the main repo final file for a more user friendly interface with some additional "nice" extras.

rov.py was the original command line based program

Plot files work as standard given the way the data is saved.

The plotting functions in rov_gui_develpopment file create folders if they don't exist and create time stamped files, running in separate threads to the main GUI
